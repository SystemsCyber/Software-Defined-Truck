SAE-J3061: Cybersecurity Guidebook for Cyber-Physical Vehicle Systems recommends the integration of cybersecurity testing at different levels of product realization. For medium and heavy-duty vehicle electronics, appropriate testing platforms, and research data are hard to find. Researchers have identified the need for remotely accessible test benches to address this problem. Testbenches with virtualized in-vehicle communication and integrated X-in-the-loop have been proposed separately in literature. To date, no system has demonstrated the ability to integrate both with actual electronic control units (ECU). 

To this end, the functional objective of this work is to develop a testbench for in-vehicle security research with virtual networking and vehicle simulation to control the output of ECUs. Network virtualization is achieved by relaying Controller Area Network (CAN) frames over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on multicast domains. Vehicle simulation is achieved through autonomous driving tools. The output of the simulation is also relayed over the virtual networks. The current version of the testbed is hosted within a laboratory network.

From a quality perspective, there are two objectives. CAN supports reliable delivery of frames. The first objective is to achieve the same over virtualized CAN. CAN is also a low latency communication protocol. UDP communication is achieved over heterogeneous media and multiple hops. Therefore, the second objective is to control the latency of the virtual network and smooth out its effect on the driving simulation.
